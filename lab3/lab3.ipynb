    "\n",
    "A Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) is a probabilistic model $p(\\bx, \\bz)$ over observed variables $\\bx$ and latent variables and/or parameters $\\bz$. Here we distinguish the decoder part, $p(\\bx | \\bz) p(\\bz)$ and an encoder part $p(\\bz | \\bx)$ that are both specified with a neural network. A lower bound on the log marginal likelihood $\\log p(\\bx)$ can be obtained by approximately inferring the latent variables z from the observed data x using an encoder distribution $q(\\bz| \\bx)$ that is also specified as a neural network. This lower bound is then optimized to fit the model to the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model was introduced by Diederik Kingma (during his PhD at the UVA) and Max Welling in 2013, https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is such an important model there are plenty of well written tutorials that should help you with the assignment. E.g: https://jaan.io/what-is-variational-autoencoder-vae-tutorial/.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will make heavily use of the torch module, https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html. Most of the time replacing `np.` with `torch.` will do the trick, e.g. `np.sum` becomes `torch.sum` and `np.log` becomes `torch.log`. In addition, we will use `torch.FloatTensor()` as an equivalent to `np.array()`. In order to train our VAE efficiently we will make use of batching. The number of data points in a batch will become the first dimension of our data tensor, e.g. A batch of 128 MNIST images has the dimensions [128, 1, 28, 28]. To check check the dimensions of a tensor you can call `.size()`."
